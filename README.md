## Executive Summary

In today’s digital-first world, businesses are flooded with customer reviews across platforms like Yelp, Google, and the App Store. This unstructured feedback holds valuable insights — but analyzing it manually is time-consuming, inconsistent, and unscalable.

Our team built a **Customer Feedback Analysis Platform** that turns massive volumes of customer reviews into actionable insights using a blend of **traditional NLP tools** and **modern AI sentiment models**, all supported by a **cloud-native, scalable architecture**.

At the heart of our pipeline is **model flexibility** — businesses can choose between fast rule-based tools like VADER, cloud-hosted solutions like Azure/Gemini, and powerful models like DistilBERT from Hugging Face. We also provide model interpretability using **SHAP values**, helping users understand what drives sentiment outcomes. 

A standout feature is our interactive SHAP Dashboard, which brings transparency to life by showcasing both global trends (which words drive sentiment across many reviews) and local explanations (how each word impacts individual predictions).

## What Our Pipeline Can Do

- Process and analyze reviews at scale using Azure Blob Storage and Databricks  
- Apply and compare multiple sentiment models (VADER, Azure, Hugging Face, Google LLM)  
- Visualize and explain results with SHAP values  
- Present insights through an **interactive dashboard** built using FastAPI and Gradio

## Why This Matters

> "Because in a world where feedback is everywhere, the companies that learn to listen the fastest… are the ones that win."

- Save time by automating sentiment detection  
- Improve customer satisfaction through data-driven decisions  
- Guide innovation with real user feedback  
- Scale seamlessly using cloud infrastructure

## How to Use This Project

### 1. Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aakashananth/BDA_Trends.git
cd customer-feedback-analysis
```

Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Sentiment Analysis Pipeline

The core logic resides in the Jupyter notebook: Sentiment Pipeline.ipynb
This notebook:
- Connects to Azure Blob Storage
- Loads and cleans Yelp review data
- Applies chosen sentiment model
- Saves processed output for visualization

### 3. Launch the Dashboard

The dashboard is built using FastAPI and Gradio. It uses the output generated by the notebook.

To run the app locally:
```bash
python app.py
```

To launch the SHAP Explanation Dashboard for interpretability:

```bash
python blocks_testing.py
```

This dashboard includes:
- Global SHAP bar plots — showcasing top positive and negative sentiment-driving words across reviews
- Local SHAP visualization — enter a custom review to see how each word affects the predicted sentiment
